# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Prediction-for-Annual-Temperature-Anomalies

### Description

This is a project for the course **Applied Time Series Analysis**. It's mainly about analyzing northern hemisphere annual temperature anomalies by Time-series techniques, building models and running model selection procedure. Finally, by the selected ARIMA model, we constructed the prediction interval of temperature anomalies which successfully covers the true values.
